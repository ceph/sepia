 Dell's DRAC out-of-band management system
===========================================

This is a collection of notes and workarounds to get most use out of DRAC.

Most of this applies to the iDRAC6 Enterprise flavor. Exceptions are
noted.

iDRAC6 Enterprise provides both three ways to interact with it:

1. SSH-based command line
2. web-based graphical user interface
3. IPMI-based (more standard, more limited) interface accessible via
   special client software
